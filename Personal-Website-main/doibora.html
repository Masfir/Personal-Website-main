            <h1>The History of Doi-Bora </h1>
            <p>

                Dahi vada is a type of chaat originating from the Indian subcontinent and popular throughout South Asia. It is prepared by soaking vadas in thick dahi. Dahi vada is known as "dahi baray" in Marathi, in Urdu, "dahi bhalla" in Punjabi, thayir vadai in Tamil, thairu vada in Malayalam, perugu vada in Telugu, mosaru vade in Kannada, dahi bara in Odia and doi bora in Bengali. A recipe for dahi wada is mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka. Washed urad lentils are soaked overnight and ground into a batter for the vada cooked in hot oil; the hot deep-fried vadas are first put in water and transferred to thick beaten yogurt. The vadas are soaked for a period of time before serving. Additions to the batter may include golden raisins. Vadas may be topped with coriander or mint leaves, chili powder, crushed black pepper, chaat masala, shredded coconut, green chilis, thinly sliced fresh ginger or pomegranate. Sweeter curd is preferred in some places in India in Maharashtra and Gujarat, although the garnishing remains the same.

                A combination of coriander and tamarind chutneys is used as garnish. The batter can be made using chick pea flour too. Punjabi cuisine Dahi puri Joshpara

            <p> The AK-230 is a Soviet automatic naval twin 30 mm gun. Its primary function is anti-aircraft, it is directed by radar. AK-230 is used, mounted on big warships as well as small craft. About 1450 guns were produced in the USSR, about 300 were produced in China as the Type 69, it was succeeded by the more powerful AK-630 from the mid-to-late 1970s. Development of the weapon began during the 1950s, with the first trial weapon fitted to the Osa class of fast attack missile boats and Shershen class torpedo boats; the weapon was accepted into service in 1969. Its service life was short, due to the fielding of the AK-630 system in the mid-1970s, which uses the same mountings and can be controlled by the same fire control systems. While its 30×210 mm round was much more powerful than the AK-630's 30×165 mm one, having the muzzle velocity of 1050 m/s, the moderately powered AK-630's round allowed for much higher rates of fire in a Gatling-type weapon, considered more advantageous for the anti-aircraft system.

                The weapon consists of two stabilized NN-30 30 mm water-cooled four chamber revolver cannons, which are mounted inside a riveted steel turret. The gun mechanism is gas operated; the guns each weigh 155 kg and have barrels 1930 mm long, a total length of 2670 mm. The barrels are rifled with 12 grooves; the guns each have a rate of fire of 1,000 round per minute. The rounds are electrically fired. Ballistic maximum range for the weapon is about 6.7 km, but realistic ranges for engaging air targets are quoted as between 2.5 and 4 km. The weapon is remote-directed by a fire-control system linked to either a Drum Tilt or Muff Cobb radar systems; the AK-230 fires specially developed 30x210B 30 mm ammunition, electrically primed. Two rounds were developed: a high-explosive round with an impact fuze, an armour-piercing round; the Chinese Type 69 fires only a locally produced version of the high-explosive round. Ammunition is produced in Romania and Serbia.
