                Old Dhaka (in Bengali, পুরনো ঢাকা ) is a term used to refer to the historic old city of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.[1] It was founded in 1608 as Jahangir Nagar, the capital of Mughal Bengal. It is located on the banks of the Buriganga River. It was one of the largest and most prosperous cities of South Asia and the center of the worldwide muslin trade. The then Nawab of Bengal Murshid Quli Khan shifted the capital from Dhaka to Murshidabad in the early-18th century. With the rise of Calcutta (now Kolkata) during the British rule, Dhaka began to decline and came to be known as the "City of Magnificent Ruins". The British however began to develop the modern city from the mid-19th century.[2]

                The existence of a settlement in the area that is now Dhaka dates from the 7th century. The city area was ruled by the Buddhist kingdom of Kamarupa and the Pala Empire before passing to the control of the Hindu Sena dynasty in the 9th century. The name of the town may have derived after the establishment of the Goddess Dhakeshvari's temple by Ballal Sena in the 12th century.

                After the Sena Empire, Dhaka was successively ruled by the Sultanate of Bengal as well as interruption[clarification needed] of governors from the Delhi Sultanate before being taken over by the Mughals in 1608. Dhaka started to grow from 1610 under the Mughal Subedhars.[7] The oldest standing mosque was built in 1454 by Bakht Binat during the rule of Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah.[7]

                The development of townships and housing has resulted in a significant growth in population came as the city was proclaimed the capital (Rajmahal) of Subah Bangalah under Mughal rule in 1608. Mughal Subahdar Islam Khan was the first administrator of the city. Khan named the town "Jahangir Nagar" (জাহাঙ্গীর নগর; City of Jahangir) in honour of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, although this name was dropped soon after Jahangir's death. Farashganj (French town) was settled by the French 1780, then known as French Market. The area is known for its 19th and early 20th century mansions.[8] Farashganj also had the presence of French East India Company.[9] The 18th and 19th century saw significant number of Armenians settle down in Armanitola, then a predominantly Armenian neighborhood. There is an Armenian Church in Armanitola.[10] The British converted an old Afghan fort into a Central Jail in 1820.[7] Das Babu, prominent merchant had a daughter Indira, whose tomb is present here. Indira road is named after her and not after Indira Gandhi as some mistakenly believe it to be.[7] Pogose School, was founded by Armenian businessman Nicholas Pogose, as the first private school in Dhaka.[11] The national political party, Bangladesh Awami League, was founded in Rose Garden Palace in 23 June 1949.
